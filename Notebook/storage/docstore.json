By contrast, classical physics explains matter and energy only on a scale familiar to human experience, including the behavior of astronomical bodies such as the Moon. Classical physics is still used in much of modern science and technology. However, towards the end of the 19th century, scientists discovered phenomena in both the large (macro) and the small (micro) worlds that classical physics could not explain.[1] The desire to resolve inconsistencies between observed phenomena and classical theory led to a revolution in physics, a shift in the original scientific paradigm:[2] the development of quantum mechanics.\n\nMany aspects of quantum mechanics are counterintuitive[3] and can seem paradoxical because they describe behavior quite different from that seen at larger scales. In the words of quantum physicist Richard Feynman, quantum mechanics deals with \"nature as She is\u2014absurd\".[4] Features of quantum mechanics often defy simple explanations in everyday language. One example of this is the uncertainty principle: precise measurements of position cannot be combined with precise measurements of velocity. Another example is entanglement: a measurement made on one particle (such as an electron that is measured to have spin 'up') will correlate with a measurement on a second particle (an electron will be found to have spin 'down') if the two particles have a shared history. This will apply even if it is impossible for the result of the first measurement to have been transmitted to the second particle before the second measurement takes place.\n\nQuantum mechanics helps people understand chemistry, because it explains how atoms interact with each other and form molecules. Many remarkable phenomena can be explained using quantum mechanics, like superfluidity. For example, if liquid helium cooled to a temperature near absolute zero is placed in a container, it spontaneously flows up and over the rim of its container; this is an effect which cannot be explained by classical physics.\n\nHistory\nMain article: History of quantum mechanics\nJames C.

Thomson in 1897 that cathode rays were not continuous but \"corpuscles\" (electrons). Electrons had been named just six years earlier as part of the emerging theory of atoms. In 1900, Max Planck, unconvinced by the atomic theory, discovered that he needed discrete entities like atoms or electrons to explain black-body radiation.[6]\n\n\nBlack-body radiation intensity vs color and temperature. The rainbow bar represents visible light; 5000 K objects are \"white hot\" by mixing differing colors of visible light. To the right is the invisible infrared. Classical theory (black curve for 5000 K) fails to predict the colors; the other curves are correctly predicted by quantum theories.\nVery hot \u2013 red hot or white hot \u2013 objects look similar when heated to the same temperature. This look results from a common curve of light intensity at different frequencies (colors), which is called black-body radiation. White hot objects have intensity across many colors in the visible range. The lowest frequencies above visible colors are infrared light, which also give off heat. Continuous wave theories of light and matter cannot explain the black-body radiation curve. Planck spread the heat energy among individual \"oscillators\" of an undefined character but with discrete energy capacity; this model explained black-body radiation.\n\nAt the time, electrons, atoms, and discrete oscillators were all exotic ideas to explain exotic phenomena. But in 1905 Albert Einstein proposed that light was also corpuscular, consisting of \"energy quanta\", in contradiction to the established science of light as a continuous wave, stretching back a hundred years to Thomas Young's work on diffraction.\n\nEinstein's revolutionary proposal started by reanalyzing Planck's black-body theory, arriving at the same conclusions by using the new \"energy quanta\".

Lenard showed that amount of current \u2013 the number of electrons \u2013 depended on the intensity of the light, but that the velocity of these electrons did not depend on intensity. This is the photoelectric effect. The continuous wave theories of the time predicted that more light intensity would accelerate the same amount of current to higher velocity, contrary to this experiment. Einstein's energy quanta explained the volume increase: one electron is ejected for each quantum: more quanta mean more electrons.[6]:\u200a23\u200a\n\nEinstein then predicted that the electron velocity would increase in direct proportion to the light frequency above a fixed value that depended upon the metal. Here the idea is that energy in energy-quanta depends upon the light frequency; the energy transferred to the electron comes in proportion to the light frequency. The type of metal gives a barrier, the fixed value, that the electrons must climb over to exit their atoms, to be emitted from the metal surface and be measured.\n\nTen years elapsed before Millikan's definitive experiment[7] verified Einstein's prediction.

In 1913 Niels Bohr and Ernest Rutherford connected the new atom models to the mystery of the Rydberg formula: the orbital radius of the electrons were constrained and the resulting energy differences matched the energy differences in the absorption lines. This meant that absorption and emission of light from atoms was energy quantized: only specific energies that matched the difference in orbital energy would be emitted or absorbed.[6]:\u200a31\u200a\n\nTrading one mystery \u2013 the regular pattern of the Rydberg formula \u2013 for another mystery \u2013 constraints on electron orbits \u2013 might not seem like a big advance, but the new atom model summarized many other experimental findings.

The same behavior can be demonstrated in water waves: the double-slit experiment was seen as a demonstration of the wave nature of light.\n\nVariations of the double-slit experiment have been performed using electrons, atoms, and even large molecules,[33][34] and the same type of interference pattern is seen.

The quantum system acts as a wave when passing through the double slits, but as a particle when it is detected. This is a typical feature of quantum complementarity: a quantum system acts as a wave in an experiment to measure its wave-like properties, and like a particle in an experiment to measure its particle-like properties.

Heisenberg won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932 for the work he did in the late 1920s.[35]\nSuppose it is desired to measure the position and speed of an object\u2014for example, a car going through a radar speed trap. It can be assumed that the car has a definite position and speed at a particular moment in time. How accurately these values can be measured depends on the quality of the measuring equipment. If the precision of the measuring equipment is improved, it provides a result closer to the true value. It might be assumed that the speed of the car and its position could be operationally defined and measured simultaneously, as precisely as might be desired.\n\nIn 1927, Heisenberg proved that this last assumption is not correct.[36] Quantum mechanics shows that certain pairs of physical properties, for example, position and speed, cannot be simultaneously measured, nor defined in operational terms, to arbitrary precision: the more precisely one property is measured, or defined in operational terms, the less precisely can the other be thus treated. This statement is known as the uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle is not only a statement about the accuracy of our measuring equipment but, more deeply, is about the conceptual nature of the measured quantities\u2014the assumption that the car had simultaneously defined position and speed does not work in quantum mechanics. On a scale of cars and people, these uncertainties are negligible, but when dealing with atoms and electrons they become critical.[37]\n\nHeisenberg gave, as an illustration, the measurement of the position and momentum of an electron using a photon of light. In measuring the electron's position, the higher the frequency of the photon, the more accurate is the measurement of the position of the impact of the photon with the electron, but the greater is the disturbance of the electron.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 14769, "end_char_idx": 16864, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a800173-367a-48c4-87cd-27a8b1bce4a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a800173-367a-48c4-87cd-27a8b1bce4a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/atharva7/Downloads/QA System/Notebook/../Data/Quantum_PHY.txt", "file_name": "Quantum_PHY.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 35270, "creation_date": "2025-06-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b3cf2c75-26e7-474d-ba8a-c9a89e363e95", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/atharva7/Downloads/QA System/Notebook/../Data/Quantum_PHY.txt", "file_name": "Quantum_PHY.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 35270, "creation_date": "2025-06-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-04"}, "hash": "6700f9bed24cf03167a4b504740734d7f3e1db53620599a4194b9222c9e67d50", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd2499f7-fc6f-4672-b363-014871740fbb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/atharva7/Downloads/QA System/Notebook/../Data/Quantum_PHY.txt", "file_name": "Quantum_PHY.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 35270, "creation_date": "2025-06-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-04"}, "hash": "f0bac0c9f28b625a3b090fb71378af7daa2e2fe619349e9fec1386e762caae64", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8f1c2816-c3d9-4b5e-97ec-34287428be37", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3a105aa9f50a1c283355c90bcb0cb69e2c5c86e336aae2f05226e27e52122df7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This is because from the impact with the photon, the electron absorbs a random amount of energy, rendering the measurement obtained of its momentum increasingly uncertain, for one is necessarily measuring its post-impact disturbed momentum from the collision products and not its original momentum (momentum which should be simultaneously measured with position). With a photon of lower frequency, the disturbance (and hence uncertainty) in the momentum is less, but so is the accuracy of the measurement of the position of the impact.[38]\n\nAt the heart of the uncertainty principle is a fact that for any mathematical analysis in the position and velocity domains, achieving a sharper (more precise) curve in the position domain can only be done at the expense of a more gradual (less precise) curve in the speed domain, and vice versa. More sharpness in the position domain requires contributions from more frequencies in the speed domain to create the narrower curve, and vice versa. It is a fundamental tradeoff inherent in any such related or complementary measurements, but is only really noticeable at the smallest (Planck) scale, near the size of elementary particles.\n\nThe uncertainty principle shows mathematically that the product of the uncertainty in the position and momentum of a particle (momentum is velocity multiplied by mass) could never be less than a certain value, and that this value is related to the Planck constant.\n\nWave function collapse\nMain article: Wave function collapse\nWave function collapse means that a measurement has forced or converted a quantum (probabilistic or potential) state into a definite measured value. This phenomenon is only seen in quantum mechanics rather than classical mechanics.\n\nFor example, before a photon actually \"shows up\" on a detection screen it can be described only with a set of probabilities for where it might show up.

When an object can definitely be \"pinned-down\" in some respect, it is said to possess an eigenstate.\n\nIn the Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment discussed above, the quantum model predicts two possible values of spin for the atom compared to the magnetic axis. These two eigenstates are named arbitrarily 'up' and 'down'. The quantum model predicts these states will be measured with equal probability, but no intermediate values will be seen. This is what the Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment shows.\n\nThe eigenstates of spin about the vertical axis are not simultaneously eigenstates of spin about the horizontal axis, so this atom has an equal probability of being found to have either value of spin about the horizontal axis. As described in the section above, measuring the spin about the horizontal axis can allow an atom that was spun up to spin down: measuring its spin about the horizontal axis collapses its wave function into one of the eigenstates of this measurement, which means it is no longer in an eigenstate of spin about the vertical axis, so can take either value.\n\nThe Pauli exclusion principle\n\nWolfgang Pauli\nMain article: Pauli exclusion principle\nIn 1924, Wolfgang Pauli proposed a new quantum degree of freedom (or quantum number), with two possible values, to resolve inconsistencies between observed molecular spectra and the predictions of quantum mechanics.

Pauli formulated his exclusion principle, stating, \"There cannot exist an atom in such a quantum state that two electrons within [it] have the same set of quantum numbers.\"[39]\n\nA year later, Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit identified Pauli's new degree of freedom with the property called spin whose effects were observed in the Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 19249, "end_char_idx": 21572, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a61c4da4-d6e5-4c27-ae10-6c61bf7f9863": {"__data__": {"id_": "a61c4da4-d6e5-4c27-ae10-6c61bf7f9863", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/atharva7/Downloads/QA System/Notebook/../Data/Quantum_PHY.txt", "file_name": "Quantum_PHY.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 35270, "creation_date": "2025-06-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b3cf2c75-26e7-474d-ba8a-c9a89e363e95", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/atharva7/Downloads/QA System/Notebook/../Data/Quantum_PHY.txt", "file_name": "Quantum_PHY.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 35270, "creation_date": "2025-06-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-04"}, "hash": "6700f9bed24cf03167a4b504740734d7f3e1db53620599a4194b9222c9e67d50", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f1c2816-c3d9-4b5e-97ec-34287428be37", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/atharva7/Downloads/QA System/Notebook/../Data/Quantum_PHY.txt", "file_name": "Quantum_PHY.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 35270, "creation_date": "2025-06-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-04"}, "hash": "eee4722891b593013f4235999fa40b881dc459bb4655cf5c73b5e23c9bd06c23", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "224979fb-f29a-44b2-b9cd-ab212e438c89", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe7359615371d88106f5ab83dcc3e155008a3f99bb6d74e29a12a20830fbddaf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Dirac wave equation\nMain article: Dirac equation\n\nPaul Dirac (1902\u20131984)\nIn 1928, Paul Dirac extended the Pauli equation, which described spinning electrons, to account for special relativity. The result was a theory that dealt properly with events, such as the speed at which an electron orbits the nucleus, occurring at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. By using the simplest electromagnetic interaction, Dirac was able to predict the value of the magnetic moment associated with the electron's spin and found the experimentally observed value, which was too large to be that of a spinning charged sphere governed by classical physics. He was able to solve for the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom and to reproduce from physical first principles Sommerfeld's successful formula for the fine structure of the hydrogen spectrum.\n\nDirac's equations sometimes yielded a negative value for energy, for which he proposed a novel solution: he posited the existence of an antielectron and a dynamical vacuum.

They invoked a principle, later known as the \"EPR criterion of reality\", positing that: \"If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e., with probability equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of reality corresponding to that quantity.\" From this, they inferred that the second particle must have a definite value of both position and of momentum prior to either quantity being measured.

Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen therefore concluded that quantum theory does not provide a complete description of reality.[41] In the same year, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger used the word \"entanglement\" and declared: \"I would not call that one but rather the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics.\"[42]\n\nThe Irish physicist John Stewart Bell carried the analysis of quantum entanglement much further. He deduced that if measurements are performed independently on the two separated particles of an entangled pair, then the assumption that the outcomes depend upon hidden variables within each half implies a mathematical constraint on how the outcomes on the two measurements are correlated. This constraint would later be named the Bell inequality. Bell then showed that quantum physics predicts correlations that violate this inequality. Consequently, the only way that hidden variables could explain the predictions of quantum physics is if they are \"nonlocal\", which is to say that somehow the two particles are able to interact instantaneously no matter how widely they ever become separated.[43][44] Performing experiments like those that Bell suggested, physicists have found that nature obeys quantum mechanics and violates Bell inequalities.

As a force is exerted, electric charges move, a current flows, and a magnetic field is produced. The changing magnetic field, in turn, causes electric current (often moving electrons). The physical description of interacting charged particles, electrical currents, electrical fields, and magnetic fields is called electromagnetism.\n\nIn 1928 Paul Dirac produced a relativistic quantum theory of electromagnetism. This was the progenitor to modern quantum electrodynamics, in that it had essential ingredients of the modern theory. However, the problem of unsolvable infinities developed in this relativistic quantum theory. Years later, renormalization largely solved this problem. Initially viewed as a provisional, suspect procedure by some of its originators, renormalization eventually was embraced as an important and self-consistent tool in QED and other fields of physics. Also, in the late 1940s Feynman diagrams provided a way to make predictions with QED by finding a probability amplitude for each possible way that an interaction could occur. The diagrams showed in particular that the electromagnetic force is the exchange of photons between interacting particles.[52]\n\nThe Lamb shift is an example of a quantum electrodynamics prediction that has been experimentally verified. It is an effect whereby the quantum nature of the electromagnetic field makes the energy levels in an atom or ion deviate slightly from what they would otherwise be. As a result, spectral lines may shift or split.\n\nSimilarly, within a freely propagating electromagnetic wave, the current can also be just an abstract displacement current, instead of involving charge carriers. In QED, its full description makes essential use of short-lived virtual particles. There, QED again validates an earlier, rather mysterious concept.\n\nStandard Model\nMain article: Standard Model\nThe Standard Model of particle physics is the quantum field theory that describes three of the four known fundamental forces (electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions \u2013 excluding gravity) in the universe and classifies all known elementary particles.

In addition, the Standard Model has predicted various properties of weak neutral currents and the W and Z bosons with great accuracy.\n\nAlthough the Standard Model is believed to be theoretically self-consistent and has demonstrated success in providing experimental predictions, it leaves some physical phenomena unexplained and so falls short of being a complete theory of fundamental interactions. For example, it does not fully explain baryon asymmetry, incorporate the full theory of gravitation as described by general relativity, or account for the universe's accelerating expansion as possibly described by dark energy. The model does not contain any viable dark matter particle that possesses all of the required properties deduced from observational cosmology. It also does not incorporate neutrino oscillations and their non-zero masses. Accordingly, it is used as a basis for building more exotic models that incorporate hypothetical particles, extra dimensions, and elaborate symmetries (such as supersymmetry) to explain experimental results at variance with the Standard Model, such as the existence of dark matter and neutrino oscillations.\n\nInterpretations\nMain article: Interpretations of quantum mechanics\nThe physical measurements, equations, and predictions pertinent to quantum mechanics are all consistent and hold a very high level of confirmation. However, the question of what these abstract models say about the underlying nature of the real world has received competing answers. These interpretations are widely varying and sometimes somewhat abstract. For instance, the Copenhagen interpretation states that before a measurement, statements about a particle's properties are completely meaningless, while the many-worlds interpretation describes the existence of a multiverse made up of every possible universe.[53]\n\nLight behaves in some aspects like particles and in other aspects like waves. Matter\u2014the \"stuff\" of the universe consisting of particles such as electrons and atoms\u2014exhibits wavelike behavior too.

A single photon is a quantum, or smallest observable particle, of the electromagnetic field. A partial photon is never experimentally observed. More broadly, quantum mechanics shows that many properties of objects, such as position, speed, and angular momentum, that appeared continuous in the zoomed-out view of classical mechanics, turn out to be (in the very tiny, zoomed-in scale of quantum mechanics) quantized. Such properties of elementary particles are required to take on one of a set of small, discrete allowable values, and since the gap between these values is also small, the discontinuities are only apparent at very tiny (atomic) scales.\n\nApplications\nMain article: Applications of quantum mechanics\nEveryday applications\nThe relationship between the frequency of electromagnetic radiation and the energy of each photon is why ultraviolet light can cause sunburn, but visible or infrared light cannot. A photon of ultraviolet light delivers a high amount of energy\u2014enough to contribute to cellular damage such as occurs in a sunburn. A photon of infrared light delivers less energy\u2014only enough to warm one's skin. So, an infrared lamp can warm a large surface, perhaps large enough to keep people comfortable in a cold room, but it cannot give anyone a sunburn.[54]\n\nTechnological applications\nApplications of quantum mechanics include the laser, the transistor, the electron microscope, and magnetic resonance imaging. A special class of quantum mechanical applications is related to macroscopic quantum phenomena such as superfluid helium and superconductors. The study of semiconductors led to the invention of the diode and the transistor, which are indispensable for modern electronics.\n\nIn even a simple light switch, quantum tunneling is absolutely vital, as otherwise the electrons in the electric current could not penetrate the potential barrier made up of a layer of oxide. Flash memory chips found in USB drives also use quantum tunneling, to erase their memory cells.[55]", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 32922, "end_char_idx": 35162, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"b3cf2c75-26e7-474d-ba8a-c9a89e363e95": {"node_ids": ["110b8fa0-5758-414f-99c5-7f69614743f3", "39b07d9c-cfee-4ef3-b732-343f82d2d005", "3bbfd0cc-1ab6-42e8-82e4-a9a5738e197f", "b432a36b-79e4-496b-aa9a-b6f4f45589e5", "1fdcff14-d0bc-4204-b937-c9363ac87166", "d8dd1b95-fcff-4aa0-b03c-7605aad87605", "f54f6cbe-8eda-4333-9d05-4f393568c1c1", "cd2499f7-fc6f-4672-b363-014871740fbb", "8a800173-367a-48c4-87cd-27a8b1bce4a0", "8f1c2816-c3d9-4b5e-97ec-34287428be37", "a61c4da4-d6e5-4c27-ae10-6c61bf7f9863", "224979fb-f29a-44b2-b9cd-ab212e438c89", "ce5e34bf-40d3-400f-a730-822349daa93d", "fa506c99-81be-475e-bbf7-224870783653", "f6728403-ce2c-4bdb-8364-afa8869d24fc", "358fc9ae-36d7-4590-bcd3-30f45ed159c8"], "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/atharva7/Downloads/QA System/Notebook/../Data/Quantum_PHY.txt", "file_name": "Quantum_PHY.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 35270, "creation_date": "2025-06-04", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-04"}}}}
